# Grouch

## About

A registration aid for [Oscar](https://oscar.gatech.edu). Simple, effective, and customizable. No login necessary. Grouch is a Python library for getting registration info for all your classes. It sends notifications using [py-notifier](https://pypi.org/project/py-notifier/) to your computer.

Oscar is a garbage site, but at least they allow students to see course info without logging in (thanks to a little trick I picked up from [Sana](https://github.com/CrimsonMarten)'s snipe bot). It's important to note that web scraping is extremely unstable since websites are updated often &mdash; even Oscar, which might be shocking considering it looks and feels like it's from the early 2000s. Literally any minor change to the layout or names or style can screw the entire scraping process. If something goes wrong, please open an issue ASAP so I can get it fixed.
